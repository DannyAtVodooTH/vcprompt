vcprompt

Version control information in your prompt (or anywhere!).

Heavily inspired by Greg Ward's vcprompt_

.. _vcprompt: http://vc.gerg.ca/hg/vcprompt/




Installing
----------

``vcprompt`` is best installed as a standalone executable:

::

    # assuming ~/bin is on your $PATH
    $ curl -s http://github.com/xvzf/vcprompt/raw/master/bin/vcprompt >> ~/bin/vcprompt
    $ chmod 755 ~/bin/vcprompt


Although not really recommended, ``vcprompt`` can be installed via PyPi:

::

    $ easy_install vcprompt




Setting up your prompt
----------------------

First, you'll want to add it to your prompt.

For bash:

::

    $ export PS1='\u@\h:\w $(vcprompt)\$'


For zsh you need to enable PROMPT_SUBST first:

::

    $ setopt prompt_subst
    $ PS1='[%n@%m] [%~] $(vcprompt)'




Basic customizing
-----------------

``vcprompt``'s output can be customized to your liking by using the
``--format`` option. For example:

::

    $ vcprompt --format "%s:%b"


If not given, the formatting string defaults to ``%s:%b``, that is the
current system and the branch. For example:

::

    git:master


The complete list of formatting arguments are as follows:

* ``%s`` - the VCS system in use
* ``%r`` - the current revision (or hash if no revision number is present)
* ``%h`` - the current hash (or revision number if no hash is present)
* ``%b`` - the current branch
* ``%i`` - the status of the repository (see below)

The status indicators for the ``%i`` argument will use the underlying
status codes from the VCS (e.g. ``git status``, ``hg status``).

For full documentation on all the options available to ``vcprompt`` see the
bundled manpages.




Requirements
------------

* Python 2.5 - 2.X
* Python 3.x (with 2to3)




TODO
----

* Add ``--ignore-env-vars`` option to stop the tests failing
* More complete support and tests for CVS
* ReST-based documentation to go along with manpages
