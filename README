vcprompt
========

Version control information in your prompt (or anywhere!).

Heavily inspired by Greg Ward's vcprompt_

.. _vcprompt: http://vc.gerg.ca/hg/vcprompt/




Installing
----------

``vcprompt`` is best installed as a standalone executable:

::

    # assuming ~/bin is on your $PATH
    $ curl -s http://github.com/xvzf/vcprompt/raw/master/bin/vcprompt > ~/bin/vcprompt
    $ chmod 755 ~/bin/vcprompt


Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run setup.py manually:

::

    $ git clone git://github.com/xvzf/vcprompt.git
    $ cd vcprompt
    $ python setup.py install




Setting up your prompt
----------------------

For bash:

::

    $ export PS1='\u@\h:\w $(vcprompt)\$'


For zsh you need to enable PROMPT_SUBST first:

::

    $ setopt prompt_subst
    $ PS1='[%n@%m] [%~] $(vcprompt)'




Basic customizing
-----------------

``vcprompt``'s output can be customized to your liking by using the
``--format`` option. For example:

::

    $ vcprompt --format "%s:%b"


If not given, the formatting string defaults to ``%s:%b``, that is the
current system and the branch. For example:

::

    git:master


The complete list of formatting arguments are as follows:

* ``%s`` - the VCS system in use
* ``%r`` - the current revision (or hash if no revision number is present)
* ``%h`` - the current hash (or revision number if no hash is present)
* ``%b`` - the current branch name (or directory where the repository exists)
* ``%m`` - shows "+" if a file has been modified

Previous versions of vcprompt included a '%i' format argument. This was removed
because it was slow, ugly and generally useless.

The only useful information this argument contained can now be duplicated using
'%m' instead.




Requirements
------------

* Python 2.5+
* Python 3.0+ (with 2to3)




Testing
-------

To run the tests, use the provided Makefile:

::

    make test


A few notes on testing:

* Tests have to fetch remote repositories, so network access is required
* Fetching remote repositories requires each VCS to be installed
